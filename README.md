# Extra information

I recommand to backup your firmware before uploading a new one. To do so on a Linux:

avrdude -C/AbsolutePathToConfigFiles/avrdude.conf -v -patmega2560 -cwiring -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:r:/AbsolutePathWhereToBackup/dump.hex:i 

You will/may have to change AbsolutePathToConfigFiles, /dev/ttyUSB0 and AbsolutePathWhereToBackup

To be confident with your backup it is a good practice to perform it twice with different names and do a diff to check that everything goes well.

To restore the firmare, the command is:

avrdude -C/AbsolutePathToConfigFiles/avrdude.conf -v -patmega2560 -cwiring -P/dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/AbsolutePathWhereToBackup/dump.hex:i 

# Tests are welcome
